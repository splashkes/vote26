### Package Descriptions - Enhanced

Based on what worked, here's improved copy:

**2025-2026 Full Season Sponsorship** (Proven winner)
- Current: "Be part of the full 2026 Art Battle Season..."
- **Improved:** "Own the year with Victoria's premier art sponsorship. Your brand becomes synonymous with live art culture across 8 high-energy events, culminating in Championship recognition. Maximum visibility. Maximum impact. All year long."

**+20 Complimentary Guests** (Most popular addon)
- Current: "Expand your reach..."
- **Improved:** "Turn your sponsorship into an experience. Bring 20 clients, partners, or VIPs to every event and watch your network light up. Each pass is a conversation starter, each event a relationship builder."

**10 Art Battle Hats** (Second most popular)
- Current: "Bring home a piece of the battle..."
- **Improved:** "Exclusive Art Battle swag that money can't buy. Limited-edition hats that turn your team into walking ambassadors for creativity. 10 premium hats that spark conversations and build brand love."

### What to Add (Lessons from other cities)

Looking at successful cities like Ottawa, San Francisco, and Sydney:

1. **Mid-tier Brand options** ($1,200-$2,500)
   - Victoria only had high-end ($5,500) and low-end addons
   - Missing the sweet spot for local businesses

2. **Personal tier entirely missing**
   - Individuals and small shops had no entry point
   - $300-$600 packages capture this market

3. **Social Media addon**
   - Modern sponsors want digital reach
   - Other cities charge $250-$500 for social boosts

4. **More variety in addons**
   - Only 3 meaningful addons (table was ignored)
   - Add: Social boost, Logo on merch, Artist meet & greet

## Victoria-Specific Considerations

**Demographics:**
- Victoria is a smaller market than Vancouver/Toronto
- Strong arts community
- Tourism-focused economy
- Many small local businesses

**Pricing Strategy:**
- Victoria prices are competitive with Toronto/Ottawa
- Full Season at $5,500 is appropriate for market
- Should add more mid-range ($1,000-$2,000) options
- Personal tier should be accessible ($300-$600)

**Event Context:**
- Capital Ballroom is a premium venue (299 capacity)
- October timing is good (fall arts season)
- Single event shown, but Full Season package sold well
